# Guessing-game-python
A simple Python-based number guessing game with scoring and feedback!
This is a simple Python-based number guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number. With every incorrect guess, feedback is provided (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low"), and the player loses points after the first attempt.

Loops
Conditional statements
